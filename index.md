## Welcome to Miron Airport Support site!

Welcome all to this new site! The High Miron Staff (SHR) has decided to privide a site where you are able to see all our guides, information and anything you need! To start the guide, we'll put some little useful links that you may use.
Links:
1. [Training Center](https://www.roblox.com/games/8695179306/RA-POLICE-training-center?gameSetTypeId=100000001&homePageSessionInfo=90fd5fbd-6e19-46c0-8e4d-2065e1e74434&isAd=false&numberOfLoadedTiles=6&page=homePage&placeId=8695179306&position=0&sortPos=10&universeId=3305016414)

Little useful information for Training Center... You are able to enter ONLY if there is currently a training/interview!

## Guides

When doing something at Miron Airport (training center or anything else) you MUST utilize a guide for some things.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wrtrrra/Miron.Support.Miron/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
